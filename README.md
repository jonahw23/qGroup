# qGroup

This is a React-powered website meant to provide teachers (or anyone else looking to make groups) with a convenient, customizable way to create groups and organizational seating layouts. Currently, it's not hosted anywhere, so to test it out on your own device you can run:

## npm run backend

followed by 

## npm run start

From there, you can create and save classes, populate them with students, and use qGroup's many customization options to create the groupings and seating layouts that you desire. 

This project is still in the beta phase, and isn't currently undergoing development.
